# Double-Genetic-Algorithm
This repository showcases a trading double <a href=https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3#:~:text=A%20genetic%20algorithm%20is%20a,offspring%20of%20the%20next%20generation.>genetic algorithm</a> that takes in a prices (open, close, high, low, volue) dataframe and industry information and automatically forms a trading strategy. The jupyter notebook in this repository defines some of the functions that run the genetic algorithm and performs an example run using the csv data and pickled object, whereas the GA_funcs py file defines the rest of the functions used to run the jupyter notebook. The locations of the functions are split between these two files because the double genetic algorithm uses multiprocessing, which requires functions to be imported from a seperate file, and best practice recommends that an if __name__ == '__main__' check is carried out, necessitating functions that implement multiprocessing to be defined within the file that uses them.

The algorithm also requires some preparatory work in terms of loading data into partial functions (this is demonstrated in the jupyter notebook). Though this preparatory work makes the genetic algorithm less accessible, it does result in significantly shorter run times. However, the algorithm does take *functions* as arguments, so the algorithm is flexible in that you can define your own fitness function or sex function (the function that breeds solutions) etc.
